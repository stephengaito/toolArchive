# Setting up cgroups

[cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups) is one of the "pillars" 
of containerization on Linux. cgroups allow a collection of software to be 
run in its own separate environment ('control group') on a Linux kernel. 

In order to run correctly in rootless mode, Podman, needs to use cgroups 
version 2. To check this `podman` looks at the `/sys/fs/cgroup` directory 
to see if it is a version 2 hierarchy. If not then `podman` assumes it is 
only able to use cgroups v1. In this cgroups v1 mode, `podman`, produces a 
number of errors, and basically does not work.

For modern Debian/Ubuntu distributions, you can force your system to run 
in cgroups v2 only mode by setting the 
`systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1` kernel parameter ... **at boot time**. 

See: [ArchLinux: Switching to cgroups 
v2](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cgroups#Switching_to_cgroups_v2) 

On a machine which uses grub to boot, edit the file `/etc/defaults/grub` 
so that the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` environment variable contains 
`systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1`. When done, my `/etc/defaults/grub` 
file had the following line: 

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1"
```

Once you have ***correctly*** added this, you need to regenerate the 
`grub.cfg` file by typing:

```
  sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

Once you are *sure* you have the correct setup, you will need to reboot 
your machine for these changes to take effect. 

You can see that they have been applied by running `podman info` if they 
worked you will see the line: 

```
  cgroupVersion: v2
```

near the top of the output.

Parameters](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters) ([set 
using grub](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters#GRUB))
