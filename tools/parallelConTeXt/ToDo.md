# Thing to do...

At the moment I am (temporarily?) archiving this project to work on other 
aspects of my overall problem. 

I have shown ways to semi-automatically "disect" a ConTeXt document into 
sub documents which can (with limited sucess) be typeset and compiled 
separately. 

I have found a (possible) way to take the TUC information from each sub 
document and "stitch" it together to form a "workable" whole (though it 
will require a lot more work to make this a reality). 

I have three scripts (in the scripts directory) which automate this 
process. 

I have managed to (more or less) capture the correct page numbers from the 
sub documents and "stitch" them in to a coherient whole.

I next need to do the same thing with the section numbering.
