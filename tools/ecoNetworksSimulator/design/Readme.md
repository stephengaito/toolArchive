# Problem

Simulate relatively realistic spatially extended trophic networks.

The objective is not to explicitly model ecological systems in
themselves, but rather to provide a platform with which to synthetically
produce large reasonably realistic data sets from which to observe the
influence of different underlying assumptions of both network structure
and data collection.

We do this by creating a R-language extension so that the resulting data 
can easily be analysed using existing R tools.

## Goals

Provide a simple system with which to generate large synthetic datasets
of reasonably realistic trophic models.

Provide a simple system to observe the possible effects of spatial and
trophic structure.
