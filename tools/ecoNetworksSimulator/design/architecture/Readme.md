# Ecological Networks Simulator -- Design

## Problem

Simulate relatively realistic spatially extended trophic networks.

The objective is not to explicitly model ecological systems in 
themselves, but rather to provide a platform with which to synthetically 
produce large reasonably realistic data sets from which to observe the 
influence of different underlying assumptions of both network structure 
and data collection.

## Goals

Provide a simple system with which to generate large synthetic datasets 
of reasonably realistic trophic models.

Provide a simple system to observe the possible effects of spatial and 
trophic structure.

## Requirements

> Provide an R-language extension to ensure all data can be specified and 
> used inside normal R-language scripts.

> Provide tools to specify trophic structure.

> Provide tools to specify spatial structure.

> Provide tools to choose parameters from simple (normal) statistical 
> distributions.

## Solution

## Questions and Risks

## Resources

It is "well known" (in the PCA/dynamical-systems folk lore) that 
rectangular spatial structure imposes additional implicit structure on 
the solutions, so we should consider using [hexagonal spatial 
cells](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/).
