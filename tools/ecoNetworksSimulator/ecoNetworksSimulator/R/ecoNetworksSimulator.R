#' Simulate ecological network models
#' 
#' Simulate relatively realistic spatially extended trophic networks.
#' 
#' The objective is not to explicitly model ecological systems in themselves,
#' but rather to provide a platform with which to synthetically produce large
#' reasonably realistic data sets from which to observe the influence of
#' different underlying assumptions of both network structure and data
#' collection.
