# AMS-LaTeX version 2 (2.14)

The following LaTeX files have been taken (unchanged) from the documentation of
the [AMS-LaTeX](http://www.ams.org/publications/authors/tex/amslatex)
[amsmath2.zip](ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amsmath2.zip) distribution:

* `amsldoc.tex` / `amsldoc.pdf` the AMS-LaTeX package's user's guide, providing
an extensive collection of examples of the use of AMS-LaTeX mathematical
commands.

* `subeqn.tex` / `subeqn.pdf` examples of using sub-equation numbering in an
AMS-LaTeX document.

* `testmath.tex` / `testmath.pdf` a sample paper using the AMS-LaTeX
mathematical commands.

in each case the `.tex` file has been taken from the `source/latex/amsmath`
directory while the corresponding `.pdf` file has been taken, for reference
purposes, from the `doc/latex/amsmath` directory.

The LICENSE file in this directory contains the LICENSE section of the file
`source/latex/amsmath/README` in the original
[amsmath2.zip](ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amsmath2.zip) distribution. It is the
[LaTeX Project Public License](http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt).

# Purpose

These three AMS-LaTeX documentation files provide an extensive test for our
LaTeXMarkdown parser.
