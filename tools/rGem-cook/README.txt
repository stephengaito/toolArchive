== DESCRIPTION:

cook is a rake extension with:

1. configuration file,
1. the ability to retrieve passwords from encrypted configuration files,
1. the ability to create files using Erubis templates,
1. the ablity to interact with both local and remote shells.

Its main file is a traditional rake Rakefile, which has recipe 
commands.  Each recipe is a collection of rake task files and 
associated YAML configuration files, allowing tasks to make use of 
extensive configuration information.  The configuration is built up 
from the various fragments in the conf files assocaited with each set 
of rake tasks.

== FEATURES:

* Based on standard ruby rake 

* Adds the ability to build up configuration from a number of separate
  configuration files overlaying the more specific configuration
  parameters over the more general parameters.

* Allows collections of related rake tasks and configuration files in 
  the form of recipe directories.

* Uses Erubis to create files from templates.

* Uses Greenletters to enable interaction with both local and remote 
  shells.

* Uses GPGme to obtain passwords from GPG encrypted configuration 
  files.

== SYNOPSIS:

  cook --config dev update

or

  cook -c prod update

to cook the update task with the additional dev or prod
configurations.

(The alternate command cookTrace is equivilant to "cook --trace -v" and 
provides considerably more output).

* construct
* erubis 
* greenletters
* gpgme
* highline (for requesting GPGme passphrase from command line)
