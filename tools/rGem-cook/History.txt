=== 2.0.9 / 2014-09-16 (external GitHub)

* Added Conf.retries to allow gl_run (GreenLetters based) processes 
which throw an exception to be retried a number of times. 

  * This allows processes conducted over noisy internet connections to 
    be automatically retried a number of times.

  * Each failed attempt is log if tracing is enabled

  * The current default retry number is 5. This can be overridden by 
    either Conf.retries (globally) or options[:retries] (locally for a 
    given gl_run call).
